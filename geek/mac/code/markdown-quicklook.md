## Enable Quicklook and Spotlight Search for Markdown Files
OS X doesn't by default Quicklook Markdown files, and it won't index the
content with Spotlight. You can tackle both problems with the
[qlmarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown) project. You can compile
from source or simply download
[QLMarkdown.qlgenerator.zip](QLMarkdown.qlgenerator.zip), unzip it and move to
~/Library/QuickLook or /Library/QuickLook.
