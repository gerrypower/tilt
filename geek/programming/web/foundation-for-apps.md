## Zurb Foundation for Apps
[Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/) is a new single-page app framework from Zurb that is closely related to
Foundation 5. It’s built around AngularJS and a flexbox grid framework. It’s intended to make
creating a web app very quick and simple, enabling us to quickly start writing the code that’s
unique to our application, rather than boilerplate. - [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/28/creating-web-app-in-foundation-for-apps/)
