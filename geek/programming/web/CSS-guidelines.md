## CSS Guidelines by Harry Roberts
CSS is not a pretty language. While it is simple to learn and get started with, it soon becomes
problematic at any reasonable scale. There isn’t much we can do to change how CSS works, but we
can make changes to the way we author and structure it.

In working on large, long-running projects, with dozens of developers of differing specialities
and abilities, it is important that we all work in a unified way in order to—among other things:

- keep stylesheets maintainable;
- keep code transparent, sane, and readable;
- keep stylesheets scalable.

There are a variety of techniques we must employ in order to satisfy these goals, and
[CSS Guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es) is a document of recommendations and approaches that will
help us to do so.
